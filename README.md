# Tic Tac Toe Flutter App

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Flutter. It's a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, typically with 'X' and 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
